To support this, the Digital Service Standards (DSS) provide guidelines for developing accessible, relevant, and seamless digital services, ensuring that all citizens, including those with disabilities, can interact with government platforms effectively . Tools like Oobee assist agencies in assessing and improving the accessibility of their digital services, while workshops and forums engage the community to gather feedback and refine these standards . Additionally, the Ministry of Digital Development and Information (MDDI) collaborates with industry leaders to enhance digital literacy and foster an inclusive digital society, empowering citizens of all ages to confidently participate in the digital world .",
